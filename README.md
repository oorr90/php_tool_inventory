# PHP Tool Inventory

The user is shown a list of tools in the inventory, and then inputs their own inventory line. Used .csv file to import inventory into the database.

## Getting Started

I used MAMP and my local server to test this project. Download the project files and insert your own databse connection details instead of the placeholders (both files require database information)
